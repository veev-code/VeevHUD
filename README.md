# VeevHUD

**A WeakAuras-inspired heads-up display for tracking cooldowns, buffs, debuffs, and resources.**

**Works out of the box** with intelligent defaults for every class and spec — no configuration required. But when you want control, VeevHUD offers **deep customization** for nearly every visual element.

## Why VeevHUD?

*   **One addon, every class** — Tailored HUDs for all classes and specs, automatically
*   **Rotation-based layouts** — Spells organized by actual rotations, not arbitrary groupings
*   **Zero setup required** — Install and play; tweak later if you want
*   **Auto-updates** — Updates through your addon manager, no re-importing WeakAura strings
*   **Minimal, aesthetic design** — Every feature is designed to convey maximum information with minimum clutter.

## How It Works

VeevHUD displays your abilities in organized rows below your character:

*   **Primary Row** — Core rotation abilities you use on cooldown
*   **Secondary Row** — Throughput cooldowns, maintenance buffs, situational abilities
*   **Utility Section** — Interrupts, CC, defensives, movement, and more

Above the ability rows, you'll find **Health & Resource Bars** and a **Proc Tracker** for important buffs.

## Key Features

### Smart Aura Display

Icons don't just show cooldowns — they show your **applied effects**. Cast a stun? The icon displays the stun duration on your target, then transitions to the cooldown after it expires.

*   **Hard CC** (Polymorph, Fear, stuns) tracks the longest duration across all targets — important since these have cooldowns or limits
*   **Damage effects** (DoTs, debuffs) track only your current target, avoiding confusion with multi-dotting
*   **Buffs and heals** track the appropriate friendly target — yourself, or your ally if you're targeting them
*   **Lockout awareness** — Abilities like Power Word: Shield (Weakened Soul) and Paladin immunities (Forbearance) show whichever restriction is longer, so you always know when you can cast again

### At-a-Glance Readability

Every visual element is designed to give you instant feedback:

*   **Resource cost display** — Icons show what percentage of required resources you have via a fill overlay, bottom bar, or resource timer (see below)
*   **Usable glow** — A proc-style glow when abilities become usable (off cooldown + enough resources)
*   **Grey out** — Unusable abilities turn grey, mimicking default action bar behavior
*   **Cast feedback** — A satisfying "pop" animation when you successfully cast
*   **GCD display** — Global cooldown shown on primary abilities

### Resource Timer (Energy/Mana)

A unique feature that **extends the cooldown spiral to show when you'll actually be able to cast** — factoring in both the cooldown AND resource regeneration.

Instead of seeing an ability go "ready" when you can't afford it, the icon shows a unified timer counting down to when you'll have enough resources. This transforms resource management from mental math into visual intuition.

**How it works:**
*   When a spell is on cooldown OR you lack resources, the spiral shows `max(cooldown_remaining, time_until_affordable)`
*   For **energy**, prediction is tick-aware (2-second ticks) and accounts for Adrenaline Rush
*   If the prediction is wrong (you spent resources or didn't regen as expected), the display falls back to a deterministic vertical fill showing real-time progress

**Resource-specific behavior:**
*   **Energy** — Highly accurate. Energy regenerates in predictable 2-second ticks, making predictions nearly perfect for rogues and feral druids.
*   **Mana** — Tick-aware with 5-second rule tracking. Mana regenerates in 2-second ticks, but at very different rates depending on whether you're inside or outside the 5-second rule. VeevHUD tracks these separately: it detects when you cast mana-costing spells, measures your "in-combat casting" regen rate (MP5 only) separately from your "passive" regen rate (full spirit), and uses the appropriate rate for predictions. Large spikes (potions, Life Tap) are filtered out.
*   **Rage** — Not predicted. Rage is generated by dealing/taking damage, which is inherently unpredictable. Rage abilities show the standard fill overlay instead.

Enabled by default. Configure via **Resource Cost Style** in settings.

### Dynamic Sort (Optional)

Enable dynamic sorting to have icons **reorder by time remaining** — the ability needing attention soonest is always on the left.

*   **DOT classes** — See which debuff is closest to expiring
*   **Cooldown-heavy rotations** — See which ability comes off cooldown next
*   **Smart tie-breaking** — When multiple abilities are ready (or have equal time), they sort by their original row position. Arrange your row as a priority order and the leftmost icon is always the next best spell to cast.

Icons slide smoothly to new positions (or snap instantly if you prefer). Off by default.

### Proc Tracker

Small icons above the health bar display important temporary buffs: Enrage, Flurry, Clearcasting, and more. They appear only when active, with optional duration text and glow effects.

### Health & Resource Bars

Compact bars positioned with your HUD show health and mana/rage/energy at a glance. Class-colored options, text overlays, and smooth animations included.

*   **Combo Points** — Rogues and Feral Druids see 5 horizontal bars below the resource bar
*   **Energy Tick Indicator** — Shows progress toward the next energy tick via a spark overlay or separate ticker bar
*   **Mana Tick Indicator** — Shows progress toward the next full-rate mana tick. Two modes: "Outside 5 Second Rule" shows the basic tick cycle, while "Next Full Tick" intelligently combines the 5-second rule and tick timing, calculating exactly when your first full spirit regen tick will arrive. Helps you time casts to maximize mana efficiency.

*   Fade on cooldown (control which rows dim)
*   GCD indicator (control which rows show it)

**Aura Tracking**
*   Show buff/debuff duration on icons
*   Include target-of-target for healers (target the boss, see your HOTs on the tank)

**Dynamic Sorting**
*   Sort by time remaining for Primary, Primary + Secondary, or keep static order
*   Animate sorting transitions or instant snap

**Resource Display**
*   Three styles: Vertical fill, bottom bar, or resource timer

## Current Status & Future Plans

VeevHUD currently supports **TBC Anniversary** only. However, VeevHUD is designed as a core engine that pulls spell data from [LibSpellDB](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libspelldb), a separate library. This architecture means future versions can support additional WoW releases (Classic Era, Wrath, Cata, Retail) by providing a spell database for that version — the HUD engine remains the same.
